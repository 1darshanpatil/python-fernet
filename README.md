Fernet encryption using flask


While sitting under a tree and carrying my laptop, as usual, people were making noise in the name of a wedding. I decided to do something that I could explain to children or something that could help children understand cryptography. Although I wanted to add lock and other images, I aimed to make it something that children in the future would be willing to use in a terminal or console-based interface.
